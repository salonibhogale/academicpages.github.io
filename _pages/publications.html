  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>Can increasing the number of politicians in village councils affect access to justice?
Re-election incentives make politicians facilitate access to justice as a form of 'constituency service'—a larger council size makes additional human resources of greater
diversity and ability available to provide such services. I examine village councils (Gram
Panchayats) in India and test whether adding additional elected members to councils
facilitates their constituents' access to the formal legal system. I do so by leveraging
population-based cutoffs and creating an original dataset on court cases filed by litigants
from over 40,000 villages over 8 years in one of the largest Indian states. I find that
citizens who live in village councils with additional members file a larger number of
cases in courts, driven by an increase in registered crime. An important driver of
the increased capacity is achieved through better political selection—larger councils
increase the representation of marginalized groups, allowing for a more diverse group of
constituents to approach council members for assistance. By highlighting the key role
played by council members, I deepen our understanding of how citizens in developing
countries access the formal legal system.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>Do shorter terms worsens legislative performance of indirectly elected members?
Shorter terms can cause elected members to shirk on their legislative responsibilities
due to a realignment of priorities, and worsen legislative performance. In this paper, we
argue that a higher quality of elected representatives can overcome negative incentives
created by shorter terms. However, once members are no longer of a higher quality,
negative incentives like shorter terms can worsen their performance. We leverage two
historical natural experiments in the the indirectly elected Rajya Sabha of the Indian
Parliament to test our theoretical propositions. Using detailed data from parliamentary
records, we show that shorter terms do not worsen the legislative performance of
positively selected members – those with higher intrinsic qualities – however, it worsens
performance of members who are not positively selected. In doing so, we contribute to
the literatures on term lengths, legislative performance and institutional design.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>This paper evaluates the effect of unfunded legal reforms on judicial productivity. I
use data and evidence from one of India’s largest state that prohibited the manufacture,
consumption and sale of alcohol and charged violators with criminal penalties - having
large effects on the criminal justice system. To evaluate the effect of the legal reform
on the judicial system, I use micro-level data on court cases and measures of judicial
productivity to provide evidence on how the unfunded mandate hampered judicial
productivity. I leverage a difference-in-differences analysis using a neighboring state
as a control group due to shared geography and historical institutions. I find that the
alcohol ban increased the demands on the justice system, decreased its efficacy and
had no effect on its efficiency. I evaluate and rule out alternate explanations pertaining
to judicial capacity, scheduling and priority changes.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>In many parts of the world, judges are transferred frequently and based on political
considerations. Judge transfers reduce court productivity and impede the speedy resolution
of court cases. We test these propositions using big data from the courts of first instance in
Uttar Pradesh, India’s largest state, and credible research designs. The data confirm that judge
transfersareindeedfrequentandpoliticized: theyoccurapproximatelyonceevery10months,
both due to and to limit political interference. Transfers reduce court productivity, and make
it less likely that cases are decided in a time-bound manner. These outcomes obtain because
transfers cause temporary judge vacancies, and since portions of cases that experience judge
transfers need to be reheard. This paper documents a major, unappreciated cause of judicial
delays and demonstrates how seemingly mundane judge staffing decisions are politicized and
can havemajor welfare implications.</p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>Understanding treatment effect heterogeneity is important, but many standard approaches to estimate
heterogeneous treatment effects rely on strong assumptions. We present a novel approach to estimate
heterogeneous treatment effects in a variety of experimental and observational set-ups commonly used in
economics and political science such as multi-arm RCTs and difference-in-differences designs. We set up
the estimation and inference problem in the form of a linear varying coefficient model and use Bayesian
Additive Regression Trees (BART) to estimate the coefficients. We demonstrate how the approach can
be leveraged to understand heterogeneity in multi-arm experiments and difference-in-differences designs.
Our approach makes no parametric assumptions about the treatment effect function and estimates it
using a flexible regression tree ensemble. We illustrate the benefits of using the approach to estimate
heterogeneous treatment effects for studies across various sub-fields of political science. In doing so, our
study adds to the growing literature on using flexible machine-learning methods for causal inference.</p>

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  <p>Does declaration of the public health emergency matter for reporting of COVID-19
deaths, and does this vary by the death reporting system in place at the county level?
While the COVID-19 public health emergency was active, deaths due to COVID-19
were required to be investigated in some states. However, the declaration ended this
requirement. We combine county-level restricted data on COVID-19 mortality and
jurisdictional information on medico-legal systems that determined whether deaths
required to be investigated by the medico-legal investigating officers (typically, coroners
or medical examiners). Our findings suggest that the declaration that ended the public
health emergency reduced the number of deaths reported whose main cause of death was
attributed to COVID-19. We also find that the decrease in death reporting is mainly in
counties which have medical examiners, suggesting that the type and manner of death
investigation carried out by different medico-legal officers influenced the COVID-19
mortality statistics.</p>
