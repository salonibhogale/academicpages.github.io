Welcome! My name is Saloni Bhogale, and I am a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://polisci.wisc.edu/" style="text-decoration: none;">Ph.D. Candidate in Political Science </a> specializing in comparative politics and political methodology, and have completed an  <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://stat.wisc.edu/">M.S. in Statistics </a> at the University of Wisconsin--Madison. My work leverages methods from causal inference to study political economy in the developing world.

My research quantifies the relationships between the design of political institutions and the services they provide to constituents, and in my three-paper dissertation, I study how institutional design affects individuals at the local and national level, particularly, how it shapes access to justice, incentives in legislatures and court productivity.

For each paper, I build a novel corpus of administrative data, which has allowed me to study important questions about political institutions with finer granularity. Additionally, I supplement robust research designs with large scale data collection, machine learning methods and qualitative interviews. This research has been supported by the National Science Foundation's Law and Science Dissertation Grant, and the Scott Kloeck-Jenson Fellowship, the Elections Research Center and the Institute for Regional and International Studies Grant at the University of Wisconsin--Madison. 

In my job market paper <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="PoliticiansJustice_SB.pdf"> Politicians Help Citizens Access Justice: Evidence from India</a>, I show that village council members help their constituents access the formal legal system as a form of constituency service by leveraging a regression discontinuity design that adds additional members at cutoffs based on the village population, applied to an original dataset of over 4 million court cases filed by litigants from 27,000 village councils. 
    
In other projects, I study natural experiments in legislatures, court efficiency, rural politics in the US and political methodology. I am affiliated with UW-Madison's <a target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/"> Center for High Throughput Computing </a> and frequently leverage scientific computing to improve performance of tasks in the research pipeline.
